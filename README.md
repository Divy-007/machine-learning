# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects
A growing collection of my machine learning notebooks — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and deployment.


## 📖 About

This repository contains my personal journey through machine learning.  
Each folder or notebook represents an individual project or experiment I’ve worked on — covering everything from basic algorithms to real-world data applications.

I use this space to practice, document, and share what I learn while exploring AI and data science.
